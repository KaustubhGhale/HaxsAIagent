# HaxsAIagent
This repository contains the code and documentation for an AI agent capable of real-time interactions to solve real-world problems autonomously. Leveraging the capabilities of the Groq API, the AI agent can understand user objectives, generate and prioritize action items, execute tasks, and adapt based on real-time feedback.
